Hi there, I'm Akhil. 

I find computers fascinating and enjoy building software. I taught myself Python to build discord bots and fell in love with coding ever since I was 16. Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduation in Computer Science at Vellore Insitute Of Technology, Andhra Pradesh. I also work as Software Engineer Intern @ [eFuse.gg](https://efuse.gg/)
